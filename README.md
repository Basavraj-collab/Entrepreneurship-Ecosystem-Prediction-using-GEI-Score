**Entrepreneurship-Ecosystem-Prediction-using-GEI-Score**


  *This project focusses on Fintech startups. It us used when they are planning to expand globally.*
  
  *FinTechs startups who are in the payments and lending space solely see entrepreneurs as their target audience. In fact, some countries have very positive ecosystems for these entrepreneurs to thrive in while others don't. This Machine Learning Model will help identify these countries.*
  
**Project Flow**
  *Started with loading of libraries and data. Merged the data with ATM users and prepared the data forimplementing Machine Learning Algorithms.*
  *Converted the data for classification and applied classification algorithm, found our Random Forest to be efficient one after cross validation.*
  *Model will predict a particular county has wide range of entrepreneurship ecosystem if its **GEI SCORE** is more than 42.*
